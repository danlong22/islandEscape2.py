refactored Island Escape game

Followed the tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFW8DJ6qsak to make a refactored version of the previous text based rpg I wrote and posted at https://github.com/danlong22/Island-Escape

This is also in need of refactoring. There are no bugs, but some of the code can be shortened, and the entire Player class can be eliminted. The tutorial assumed there would be a choice in what job the player's character has, but there is no such choice in this game. I'll later get rid of the OOP class and replace it with global variables in later versions.
